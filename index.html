		<p><strong>Course Overview:</strong> How can we learn from a data set of sensitive information while providing meaningful privacy to the individuals whose information it contains? The course explores this question, starting from the problems faced by straightforward solutions and moving on to rigorous state-of-the-art solutions using differential privacy. The class will focus on foundations, but also delve into some applied work and on some of the social, ethical, and legal context for the subject. Students will be required to complete some mathematical assignments, some light programming assignments, and a final course project.
